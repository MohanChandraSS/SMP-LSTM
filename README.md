Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM
This project predicts stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, trained on historical stock data from ADANIPORTS, RELIANCE, and TCS.

Key Features:
LSTM Architecture: 2 LSTM layers (10 neurons each) with Dropout for regularization.
Evaluation: Performance evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Feel free to explore the code and dataset for more details on the implementation!
